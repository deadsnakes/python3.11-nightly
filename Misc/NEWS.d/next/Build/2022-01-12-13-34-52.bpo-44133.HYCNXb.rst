When Python is built without :option:`--enable-shared`, the ``python``
program is now linked to object files, rather than being linked to the Python
static library (libpython.a), to make sure that all symbols are exported.
Previously, the linker omitted some symbols like the :c:func:`Py_FrozenMain`
function. Patch by Victor Stinner.
