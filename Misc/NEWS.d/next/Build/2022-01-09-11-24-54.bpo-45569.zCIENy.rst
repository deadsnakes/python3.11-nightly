The build now defaults to using 30-bit digits for Python integers. Previously
either 15-bit or 30-bit digits would be selected, depending on the platform.
15-bit digits may still be selected using the ``--enable-big-digits=15`` option
to the ``configure`` script, or by defining ``PYLONG_BITS_IN_DIGIT`` in
``pyconfig.h``.
