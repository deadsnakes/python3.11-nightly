The ``<Python.h>`` header file no longer includes ``<stdlib.h>``. C
extensions using ``<stdlib.h>`` must now include it explicitly.
The system ``<stdlib.h>`` header provides functions like:
``malloc()``/``free()``, ``getenv()``, ``strtol()``, ``abs()``, ``strtol()``,
``exit()`` and ``abort()``.
Patch by Victor Stinner.
