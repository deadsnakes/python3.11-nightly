The non-limited API files ``cellobject.h``, ``classobject.h``, ``context.h``,
``funcobject.h``, ``genobject.h`` and ``longintrepr.h`` have been moved to
the ``Include/cpython`` directory. Moreover, the ``eval.h`` header file was
removed. These files must not be included directly, as they are already
included in ``Python.h``: :ref:`Include Files <api-includes>`. If they have
been included directly, consider including ``Python.h`` instead.
Patch by Victor Stinner.
