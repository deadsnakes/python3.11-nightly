:c:func:`PyBuffer_GetPointer`, :c:func:`PyBuffer_FromContiguous`, :c:func:`PyBuffer_ToContiguous` and :c:func:`PyMemoryView_FromBuffer` now take buffer info by ``const Py_buffer *`` instead of ``Py_buffer *``, as they do not need mutability. :c:func:`PyBuffer_FromContiguous` also now takes the source buffer as ``const void *``, and similarly :c:func:`PyBuffer_GetPointer` takes the strides as ``const Py_ssize_t *``.
