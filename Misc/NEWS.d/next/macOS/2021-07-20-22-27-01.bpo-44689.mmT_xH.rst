 :meth:`ctypes.util.find_library` now works correctly on macOS 11 Big Sur
 even if Python is built on an older version of macOS.  Previously, when
 built on older macOS systems, ``find_library`` was not able to find
 macOS system libraries when running on Big Sur due to changes in
 how system libraries are stored.
