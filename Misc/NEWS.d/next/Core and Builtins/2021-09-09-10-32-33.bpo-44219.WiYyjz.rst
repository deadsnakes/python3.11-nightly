Release the GIL while performing ``isatty`` system calls on arbitrary file
descriptors. In particular, this affects :func:`os.isatty`,
:func:`os.device_encoding` and :class:`io.TextIOWrapper`. By extension,
:func:`io.open` in text mode is also affected. This change solves
a deadlock in :func:`os.isatty`. Patch by Vincent Michel in :issue:`44219`.
