At Python exit, sometimes a thread holding the GIL can wait forever for a
thread (usually a daemon thread) which requested to drop the GIL, whereas
the thread already exited. To fix the race condition, the thread which
requested the GIL drop now resets its request before exiting. Issue
discovered and analyzed by Mingliang ZHAO. Patch by Victor Stinner.
