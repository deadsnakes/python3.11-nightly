Use two or three bytecodes to implement most calls.

Calls without named arguments are implemented as a sequence of two
instructions: ``PRECALL; CALL``. Calls with named arguments are implemented
as a sequence of three instructions: ``PRECALL; KW_NAMES; CALL``. There are
two different ``PRECALL`` instructions: ``PRECALL_FUNTION`` and
``PRECALL_METHOD``. The latter pairs with ``LOAD_METHOD``.

This partition into pre-call and call allows better specialization, and thus
better performance ultimately.

There is no change in semantics.
