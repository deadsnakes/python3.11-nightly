Emscripten builds cannot handle signals in the usual way due to platform
limitations. Python can now handle signals. To use, set
Module.Py_EmscriptenSignalBuffer to be a single byte SharedArrayBuffer and
set Py_EMSCRIPTEN_SIGNAL_HANDLING to 1. Writing a number into the
SharedArrayBuffer will cause the corresponding signal to be raised into the
Python thread.
