For frozen stdlib modules, record the original module name as
``module.__spec__.loader_state.origname``.  If the value is different than
``module.__spec__.name`` then the module was defined as an alias in
Tools/scripts/freeze_modules.py.  If it is ``None`` then the module comes
from a source file outside the stdlib.
