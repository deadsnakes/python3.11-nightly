Cases of sorting using tuples as keys may now be significantly faster
in some cases. Patch by Tim Peters.

The order of the result may differ from earlier releases if the tuple
elements don't define a total ordering (see
:ref:`expressions-value-comparisons` for information on
total ordering).  It's generally true that the result of sorting simply
isn't well-defined in the absence of a total ordering on list elements.
