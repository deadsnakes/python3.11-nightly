Frozen stdlib modules now have ``__file__`` to the .py file they would
otherwise be loaded from, if possible.  For packages, ``__path__`` now has
the correct entry instead of being an empty list, which allows unfrozen
submodules to be imported.  These are set only if the stdlib directory is
known when the runtime is initialized.  Note that the file at ``__file__``
is not guaranteed to exist.  None of this affects non-stdlib frozen modules
nor, for now, frozen modules imported using
``PyImport_ImportFrozenModule()``.  Also, at the moment ``co_filename`` is
not updated for the module.
