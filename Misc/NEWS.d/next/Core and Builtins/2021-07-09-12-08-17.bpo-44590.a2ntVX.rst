All necessary data for executing a Python function (local variables, stack,
etc) is now kept in a per-thread stack. Frame objects are lazily allocated
on demand. This increases performance by about 7% on the standard benchmark
suite. Introspection and debugging are unaffected as frame objects are
always available when needed. Patch by Mark Shannon.
