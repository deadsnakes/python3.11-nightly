ctypes used to mishandle ``void`` return types, so that for instance a
function declared like ``ctypes.CFUNCTYPE(None, ctypes.c_int)`` would be
called with signature ``int f(int)`` instead of ``void f(int)``. Wasm
targets require function pointers to be called with the correct signatures
so this led to crashes. The problem is now fixed.
