Fix a race condition on setting a type ``__bases__`` attribute: the internal
function ``add_subclass()`` now gets the ``PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses``
member after calling :c:func:`PyWeakref_NewRef` which can trigger a garbage
collection which can indirectly modify ``PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses``. Patch
by Victor Stinner.
