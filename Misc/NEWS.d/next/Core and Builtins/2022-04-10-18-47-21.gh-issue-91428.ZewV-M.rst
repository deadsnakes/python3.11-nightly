Add ``static const char *const _PyOpcode_OpName[256] = {...};`` to
``opcode.h`` for debug builds to assist in debugging the Python interpreter.
It is now more convenient to make various forms of debugging output more
human-readable by including opcode names rather than just the corresponding
decimal digits.
