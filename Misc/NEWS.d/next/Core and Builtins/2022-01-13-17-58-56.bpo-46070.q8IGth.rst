:c:func:`Py_EndInterpreter` now explicitly untracks all objects currently
tracked by the GC. Previously, if an object was used later by another
interpreter, calling :c:func:`PyObject_GC_UnTrack` on the object crashed if the
previous or the next object of the :c:type:`PyGC_Head` structure became a
dangling pointer. Patch by Victor Stinner.
