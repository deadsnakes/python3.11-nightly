Fix a crash in subinterpreters related to the garbage collector. When a
subinterpreter is deleted, untrack all objects tracked by its GC. To prevent a
crash in deallocator functions expecting objects to be tracked by the GC, leak
a strong reference to these objects on purpose, so they are never deleted and
their deallocator functions are not called. Patch by Victor Stinner.
