List sorting now uses the merge-ordering strategy from Munro and Wild's ``powersort()``. Unlike the former strategy, this is provably near-optimal in the entropy of the distribution of run lengths. Most uses of ``list.sort()`` probably won't see a significant time difference, but may see significant improvements in cases where the former strategy was exceptionally poor. However, as these are all fast linear-time approximations to a problem that's inherently at best quadratic-time to solve truly optimally, it's also possible to contrive cases where the former strategy did better.
