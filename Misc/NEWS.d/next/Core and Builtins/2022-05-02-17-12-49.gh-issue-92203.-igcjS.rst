Add a closure keyword-only parameter to exec(). It can only be specified
when exec-ing a code object that uses free variables. When specified, it
must be a tuple, with exactly the number of cell variables referenced by the
code object. closure has a default value of None, and it must be None if the
code object doesn't refer to any free variables.
