The deallocator function of the :exc:`BaseException` type now uses the
trashcan mecanism to prevent stack overflow. For example, when a
:exc:`RecursionError` instance is raised, it can be linked to another
RecursionError through the ``__context__`` attribute or the
``__traceback__`` attribute, and then a chain of exceptions is created. When
the chain is destroyed, nested deallocator function calls can crash with a
stack overflow if the chain is too long compared to the available stack
memory. Patch by Victor Stinner.
