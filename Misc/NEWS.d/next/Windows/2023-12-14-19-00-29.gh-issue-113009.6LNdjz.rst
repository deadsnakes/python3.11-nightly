:mod:`multiprocessing`: On Windows, fix a race condition in
``Process.terminate()``: no longer set the ``returncode`` attribute to
always call ``WaitForSingleObject()`` in ``Process.wait()``.  Previously,
sometimes the process was still running after ``TerminateProcess()`` even if
``GetExitCodeProcess()`` is not ``STILL_ACTIVE``. Patch by Victor Stinner.
