The installer now has more strict rules about updating the :ref:`launcher`.
In general, most users only have a single launcher installed and will see no
difference. When multiple launchers have been installed, the option to
install the launcher is disabled until all but one have been removed.
Downgrading the launcher (which was never allowed) is now more obviously
blocked.
