typing: Fix a bug relating to substitution in custom classes generic over a
:class:`~typing.ParamSpec`. Previously, if the ``ParamSpec`` was substituted
with a parameters list that itself contained a :class:`~typing.TypeVar`, the
``TypeVar`` in the parameters list could not be subsequently substituted. This
is now fixed.

Patch by Nikita Sobolev.
