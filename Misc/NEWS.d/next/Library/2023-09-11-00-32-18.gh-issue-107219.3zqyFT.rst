Fix a race condition in ``concurrent.futures``. When a process in the
process pool was terminated abruptly (while the future was running or
pending), close the connection write end. If the call queue is blocked on
sending bytes to a worker process, closing the connection write end interrupts
the send, so the queue can be closed. Patch by Victor Stinner.
