:meth:`~datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp` no longer attempts to resolve
``fold`` in the pure Python implementation, since the fold is never 1 in UTC.
In addition to being slightly faster in the common case, this also prevents
some errors when the timestamp is close to :attr:`datetime.min
<datetime.datetime.min>`.  Patch by Paul Ganssle.
