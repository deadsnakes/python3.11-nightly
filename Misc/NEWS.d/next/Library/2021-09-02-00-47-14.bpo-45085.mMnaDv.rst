The ``binhex`` module, deprecated in Python 3.9, is now removed. The
following :mod:`binascii` functions, deprecated in Python 3.9, are now also
removed:

* ``a2b_hqx()``, ``b2a_hqx()``;
* ``rlecode_hqx()``, ``rledecode_hqx()``.

The :func:`binascii.crc_hqx` function remains available.

Patch by Victor Stinner.
