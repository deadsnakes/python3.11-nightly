Fixed a bug that caused :mod:`hmac` to raise an exception when the requested
hash algorithm was not available in OpenSSL despite being available
separately as part of ``hashlib`` itself.  It now falls back properly to the
built-in. This could happen when, for example, your OpenSSL does not include
SHA3 support and you want to compute ``hmac.digest(b'K', b'M',
'sha3_256')``.
