Remove an unhandled error case in the C implementation of calls to
:meth:`datetime.fromtimestamp <datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp>` with no time
zone (i.e. getting a local time from an epoch timestamp). This should have no
user-facing effect other than giving a possibly more accurate error message
when called with timestamps that fall on 10000-01-01 in the local time. Patch
by Paul Ganssle.
