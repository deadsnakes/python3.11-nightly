Added ``importlib.simple`` module implementing adapters from a low-level
resources reader interface to a ``TraversableResources`` interface. Legacy
API (``path``, ``contents``, ...) is now supported entirely by the
``.files()`` API with a compatibility shim supplied for resource loaders
without that functionality. Feature parity with ``importlib_resources`` 5.2.
