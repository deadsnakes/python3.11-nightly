When built against OpenSSL 3.0, the :mod:`ssl` module had a bug where it
reported unauthenticated EOFs (i.e. without close_notify) as a clean TLS-level
EOF. It now raises :exc:`~ssl.SSLEOFError`, matching the behavior in previous
versions of OpenSSL. The :attr:`~ssl.SSLContext.options` attribute on
:class:`~ssl.SSLContext` also no longer includes
:data:`~ssl.OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF` by default. This option may be set to
specify the previous OpenSSL 3.0 behavior.
