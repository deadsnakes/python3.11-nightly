Method :meth:`~unittest.TestResult.stopTestRun` is now always called in pair
with method :meth:`~unittest.TestResult.startTestRun` for
:class:`~unittest.TestResult` objects implicitly created in
:meth:`~unittest.TestCase.run`. Previously it was not called for test
methods and classes decorated with a skipping decorator.
