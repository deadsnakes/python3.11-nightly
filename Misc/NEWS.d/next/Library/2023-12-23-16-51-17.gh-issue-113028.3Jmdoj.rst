When a second reference to a string appears in the input to :mod:`pickle`,
and the Python implementation is in use,
we are guaranteed that a single copy gets pickled
and a single object is shared when reloaded.
Previously, in protocol 0, when a string contained certain characters
(e.g. newline) it resulted in duplicate objects.
