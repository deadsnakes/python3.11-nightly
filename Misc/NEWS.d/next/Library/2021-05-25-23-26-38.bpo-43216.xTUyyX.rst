Remove the :func:`@asyncio.coroutine <asyncio.coroutine>` :term:`decorator`
enabling legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await
code; remove :class:`asyncio.coroutines.CoroWrapper` used for wrapping
legacy coroutine objects in the debug mode. The decorator has been deprecated
since Python 3.8 and the removal was initially scheduled for Python 3.10.
Patch by Illia Volochii.
