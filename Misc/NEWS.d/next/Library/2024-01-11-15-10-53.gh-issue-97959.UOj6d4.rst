Fix rendering class methods, bound methods, method and function aliases in
:mod:`pydoc`. Class methods no longer have "method of builtins.type
instance" note. Corresponding notes are now added for class and unbound
methods. Method and function aliases now have references to the module or
the class where the origin was defined if it differs from the current. Bound
methods are now listed in the static methods section. Methods of builtin
classes are now supported as well as methods of Python classes.
