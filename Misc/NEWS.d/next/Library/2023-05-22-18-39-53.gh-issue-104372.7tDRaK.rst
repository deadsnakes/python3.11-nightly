On Linux where :mod:`subprocess` can use the ``vfork()`` syscall for faster
spawning, prevent the parent process from blocking other threads by dropping
the GIL while it waits for the vfork'ed child process ``exec()`` outcome.
This prevents spawning a binary from a slow filesystem from blocking the
rest of the application.
