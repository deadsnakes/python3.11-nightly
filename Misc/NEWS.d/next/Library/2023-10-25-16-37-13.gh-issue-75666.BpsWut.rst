Fix the behavior of :mod:`tkinter` widget's ``unbind()`` method with two
arguments. Previously, ``widget.unbind(sequence, funcid)`` destroyed the
current binding for *sequence*, leaving *sequence* unbound, and deleted the
*funcid* command. Now it removes only *funcid* from the binding for
*sequence*, keeping other commands, and deletes the *funcid* command. It
leaves *sequence* unbound only if *funcid* was the last bound command.
