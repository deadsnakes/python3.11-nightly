:func:`zlib.compress` now accepts a wbits parameter which allows users to
compress data as a raw deflate block without zlib headers and trailers in
one go. Previously this required instantiating a ``zlib.compressobj``. It
also provides a faster alternative to ``gzip.compress`` when wbits=31 is
used.
