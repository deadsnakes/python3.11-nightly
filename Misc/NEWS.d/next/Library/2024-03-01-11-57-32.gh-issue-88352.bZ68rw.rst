Fix the computation of the next rollover time in the
:class:`logging.TimedRotatingFileHandler` handler. :meth:`!computeRollover`
now always returns a timestamp larger than the specified time and works
correctly during the DST change. :meth:`!doRollover` no longer overwrite the
already rolled over file, saving from data loss when run at midnight or
during repeated time at the DST change.
