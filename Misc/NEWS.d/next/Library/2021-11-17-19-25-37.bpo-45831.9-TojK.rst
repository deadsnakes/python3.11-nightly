:mod:`faulthandler` can now write ASCII-only strings (like filenames and
function names) with a single write() syscall when dumping a traceback. It
reduces the risk of getting an unreadable dump when two threads or two
processes dump a traceback to the same file (like stderr) at the same time.
Patch by Victor Stinner.
