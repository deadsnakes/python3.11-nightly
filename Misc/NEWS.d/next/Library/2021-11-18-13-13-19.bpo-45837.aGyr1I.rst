The :meth:`turtle.RawTurtle.settiltangle` is deprecated since Python 3.1,
it now emits a deprecation warning and will be removed in Python 3.13.

Use :meth:`turtle.RawTurtle.tiltangle` instead.

:meth:`turtle.RawTurtle.tiltangle` was earlier incorrectly marked as deprecated,
its docstring has been corrected.

Patch by Hugo van Kemenade.
