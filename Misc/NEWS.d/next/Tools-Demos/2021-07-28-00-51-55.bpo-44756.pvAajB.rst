In the Makefile for documentation (:file:`Doc/Makefile`), the ``build`` rule
is dependent on the ``venv`` rule. Therefore, ``html``, ``latex``, and other
build-dependent rules are also now dependent on ``venv``. The ``venv`` rule
only performs an action if ``$(VENVDIR)`` does not exist.
:file:`Doc/README.rst` was updated; most users now only need to type ``make
html``.
