Skip ``test_gdb`` if gdb is unable to retrieve Python frame objects: if a
frame is ``<optimized out>``. When Python is built with "clang -Og", gdb can
fail to retrive the *frame* parameter of ``_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()``. In
this case, tests like ``py_bt()`` are likely to fail. Without getting access
to Python frames, ``python-gdb.py`` is mostly clueless on retrieving the
Python traceback. Moreover, ``test_gdb`` is no longer skipped on macOS if
Python is built with Clang. Patch by Victor Stinner.
