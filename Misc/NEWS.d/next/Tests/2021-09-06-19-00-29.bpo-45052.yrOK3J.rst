``WithProcessesTestSharedMemory.test_shared_memory_basics`` test was
ignored, because ``self.assertEqual(sms.size, sms2.size)`` line was failing.
It is now removed and test is unskipped.

The main motivation for this line to be removed from the test is that the
``size`` of ``SharedMemory`` is not ever guaranteed to be the same. It is
decided by the platform.
