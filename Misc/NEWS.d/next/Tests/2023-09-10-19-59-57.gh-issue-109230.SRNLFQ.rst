Fix ``test_pyexpat.test_exception()``: it can now be run from a directory
different than Python source code directory. Before, the test failed in this
case.  Skip the test if Modules/pyexpat.c source is not available. Skip also
the test on Python implementations other than CPython. Patch by Victor
Stinner.
