:source:`Lib/test/test_asyncio/test_ssl.py` exposed a bug in the macOS
kernel where intense concurrent load on non-blocking sockets occasionally
causes :const:`errno.ENOBUFS` ("No buffer space available") to be emitted.
FB11063974 filed with Apple, in the mean time as a workaround buffer size
used in tests on macOS is decreased to avoid intermittent failures.  Patch
by Fantix King.
