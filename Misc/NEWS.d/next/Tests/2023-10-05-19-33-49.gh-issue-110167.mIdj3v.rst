Fix a deadlock in test_socket when server fails with a timeout but the
client is still running in its thread. Don't hold a lock to call cleanup
functions in doCleanups(). One of the cleanup function waits until the
client completes, whereas the client could deadlock if it called
addCleanup() in such situation. Patch by Victor Stinner.
