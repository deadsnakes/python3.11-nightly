Add auditing events to the :mod:`marshal` module, and stop raising
``code.__init__`` events for every unmarshalled code object. Directly
instantiated code objects will continue to raise an event, and audit event
handlers should inspect or collect the raw marshal data. This reduces a
significant performance overhead when loading from ``.pyc`` files.
