``python -m http.server`` no longer allows terminal control characters sent
within a garbage request to be printed to the stderr server log.

This is done by changing the :mod:`http.server` :class:`BaseHTTPRequestHandler`
``.log_message`` method to replace control characters with a ``\xHH`` hex escape
before printing.
