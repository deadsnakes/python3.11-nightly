Title: Python Tutorial (v@VER@)
Author: Guido van Rossum, Fred L. Drake, Jr., editor
Abstract: This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic
 concepts and features of the Python language and system.  It helps
 to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but
 all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read
 off-line as well.
