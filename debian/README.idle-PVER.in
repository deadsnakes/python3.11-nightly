  The Python IDLE package for Debian
  ----------------------------------

This package contains Python @VER@'s Integrated DeveLopment Environment, IDLE.

IDLE is included in the Python @VER@ upstream distribution (Tools/idle) and
depends on Tkinter (available as @PVER@-tk package).

I have written a simple man page.
