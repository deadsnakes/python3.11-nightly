Title: Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter (v@VER@)
Author: Guido van Rossum
Abstract: This document describes how to write modules in C or C++ to extend
 the Python interpreter with new modules.  Those modules can define
 new functions but also new object types and their methods.  The
 document also describes how to embed the Python interpreter in
 another application, for use as an extension language.  Finally,
 it shows how to compile and link extension modules so that they
 can be loaded dynamically (at run time) into the interpreter, if
 the underlying operating system supports this feature.
