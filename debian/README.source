The source tarball is lacking the files Lib/profile.py and Lib/pstats.py,
which Debian considers to have a license non-suitable for main (the use
of these modules limited to python).

The package uses quilt to apply / unapply patches.
See /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.  The series file is generated
during the build.
