# Requirements to build the Python documentation

# Sphinx version is pinned so that new versions that introduce new warnings
# won't suddenly cause build failures. Updating the version is fine as long
# as no warnings are raised by doing so.
sphinx==4.5.0

blurb

# sphinx-lint 0.6.2 yields many default role errors due to the new regular
# expression used for default role detection, so we don't use the version
# until the errors are fixed.
sphinx-lint==0.6.4

# The theme used by the documentation is stored separately, so we need
# to install that as well.
python-docs-theme>=2022.1
